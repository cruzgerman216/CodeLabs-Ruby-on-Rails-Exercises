**Further Exploration/Challenges**

- Create a view partial that is a navigation bar
- Create a custom query by defining a [scope](https://www.rubyguides.com/2019/10/scopes-in-ruby-on-rails/#:~:text=Scopes%20are%20custom%20queries%20that,lambda%2C%20which%20implements%20the%20query.) in your model
-  Make sure your controllers don't consume too much logic [(Skinny controller, fat model)(PORO)](https://sulmanweb.com/plain-old-ruby-objects-poros-in-rails-fat-models/)
